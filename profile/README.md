## The ecosystem around Signals.

We can see the different versions of implementations of one algorithm.

- [@preactjs/signals-react](https://github.com/preactjs/signals#guide--api)
- [@angular/signals](https://angular.io/guide/signals)
- MobX, Vue, SolidJS
- [mobx-signals](https://npmjs.com/mobx-signals) facade

And each time it's a different implementation. If you see to source code of each one, everywhere implementation will be different.
Programmer friends, I urge you. Let's write the minimum and most productive code for this algorithm and offer to integrate it into all these libraries. This is how we can maximize the growth of reactive library syntax improvement, as well as the performance increase for all of these frameworks.

Minimal algorithm implementation is currently located in the [re-js/reactive-box](https://github.com/re-js/reactive-box). The repository also contains the tests for algorithm checking.

I will ask for attention, especially from masters of olympiads, and amazing kind guys who have a keen, huge, and clever interest in the complex algorithmic task!

Enjoy your signals!
