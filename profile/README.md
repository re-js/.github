The ecosystem around Signal abstraction.

We can see different versions of implementations of one algoritm.

- @preactjs/signals-react
- @angular/signals
- MobX, Vue, SolidJS

And each time it's different implementation.
If you see to source code of each one, everythere implementation will be different.

Programmer friends, I urge you. Let's write the minimum and most productive code for this algorithm and offer to integrate it into all these libraries. This is how we can maximize the growth of reactive library syntax improvement, as well as the performance increase for all of these frameworks.

Minimal algoritm implementation located in the [re-js/reactive-box](https://github.com/re-js/reactive-box). Repository also contains the tests for algoritm checking.

## Signal abstraction

The signal - is a new name for an old phenomenon.
